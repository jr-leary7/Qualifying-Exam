	abstract = {Summary 
            A general class of statistical models for a univariate response variable is presented which we call the generalized additive model for location, scale and shape (GAMLSS). The model assumes independent observations of the response variable y given the parameters, the explanatory variables and the values of the random effects. The distribution for the response variable in the GAMLSS can be selected from a very general family of distributions including highly skew or kurtotic continuous and discrete distributions. The systematic part of the model is expanded to allow modelling not only of the mean (or location) but also of the other parameters of the distribution of y, as parametric and/or additive nonparametric (smooth) functions of explanatory variables and/or random-effects terms. Maximum (penalized) likelihood estimation is used to fit the (non)parametric models. A Newton–Raphson or Fisher scoring algorithm is used to maximize the (penalized) likelihood. The additive terms in the model are fitted by using a backfitting algorithm. Censored data are easily incorporated into the framework. Five data sets from different fields of application are analysed to emphasize the generality of the GAMLSS class of models.},

            Structured additive regression models are perhaps the most commonly used class of models in statistical applications. It includes, among others, (generalized) linear models, (generalized) additive models, smoothing spline models, state space models, semiparametric regression, spatial and spatiotemporal models, log-Gaussian Cox processes and geostatistical and geoadditive models. We consider approximate Bayesian inference in a popular subset of structured additive regression models, latent Gaussian models, where the latent field is Gaussian, controlled by a few hyperparameters and with non-Gaussian response variables. The posterior marginals are not available in closed form owing to the non-Gaussian response variables. For such models, Markov chain Monte Carlo methods can be implemented, but they are not without problems, in terms of both convergence and computational time. In some practical applications, the extent of these problems is such that Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling is simply not an appropriate tool for routine analysis. We show that, by using an integrated nested Laplace approximation and its simplified version, we can directly compute very accurate approximations to the posterior marginals. The main benefit of these approximations is computational: where Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms need hours or days to run, our approximations provide more precise estimates in seconds or minutes. Another advantage with our approach is its generality, which makes it possible to perform Bayesian analysis in an automatic, streamlined way, and to compute model comparison criteria and various predictive measures so that models can be compared and the model under study can be challenged.},

	abstract = {Restricted maximum likelihood (REML) estimation is a widely accepted and frequently used method for fitting linear mixed models, with its principal advantage being that it produces less biased estimates of the variance components. However, the concept of REML does not immediately generalize to the setting of non-normally distributed responses, and it is not always clear the extent to which, either asymptotically or in finite samples, such generalizations reduce the bias of variance component estimates compared to standard unrestricted maximum likelihood estimation. In this article, we review various attempts that have been made over the past four decades to extend REML estimation in generalized linear mixed models. We establish four major classes of approaches, namely approximate linearization, integrated likelihood, modified profile likelihoods, and direct bias correction of the score function, and show that while these four classes may have differing motivations and derivations, they often arrive at a similar if not the same REML estimate. We compare the finite sample performance of these four classes through a numerical study involving binary and count data, with results demonstrating that they perform similarly well in reducing the finite sample bias of variance components.},

In particular, we examine settings where the fully conditional mean does not equal the marginal mean as well as hypothesis testing following selection of the working correlation matrix. Our results suggest that the use of any information criterion for selection of the working correlation matrix is inappropriate when the conditional mean model assumption is violated. We also find that type I error differs from the nominal level in moderate sample sizes following selection of the form of the working correlation but improves as sample size is increased as the selection is then concentrated on a single correlation structure. Our results serve to underline the potential dangers that can arise when using information criteria to select correlation structure in routine data analysis.

              Correlated response data are common in biomedical studies. Regression analysis based on the generalized estimating equations (GEE) is an increasingly important method for such data. However, there seem to be few model‐selection criteria available in GEE. The well‐known Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) cannot be directly applied since AIC is based on maximum likelihood estimation while GEE is nonlikelihood based. We propose a modification to AIC, where the likelihood is replaced by the quasi‐likelihood and a proper adjustment is made for the penalty term. Its performance is investigated through simulation studies. For illustration, the method is applied to a real data set.},

	abstract = {This book is an introduction to the field of asymptotic statistics. The treatment is both practical and mathematically rigorous. In addition to most of the standard topics of an asymptotics course, including likelihood inference, M-estimation, the theory of asymptotic efficiency, U-statistics, and rank procedures, the book also presents recent research topics such as semiparametric models, the bootstrap, and empirical processes and their applications. The topics are organized from the central idea of approximation by limit experiments, which gives the book one of its unifying themes. This entails mainly the local approximation of the classical i.i.d. set up with smooth parameters by location experiments involving a single, normally distributed observation. Thus, even the standard subjects of asymptotic statistics are presented in a novel way. Suitable as a graduate or Master's level statistics text, this book will also give researchers an overview of research in asymptotic statistics.},
